# Neovim Configuration

**THIS REPO IS quasi-ARCHIVED, AND A NEW REPO 'nvim-config' WILL BE CREATED.**

The term 'quasi-archived' here means

1. that there would still be some updates, but no new plugins,
2. and that I simply 'read' this repo but do not use it anymore.

A new repo named 'vim-config' would be created in the distant futrue (which
rather means 'I don't even know when'). The repo 'vim-config' would resemble
this repo.
